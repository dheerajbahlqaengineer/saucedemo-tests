# LLM Usage Documentation

## LLM Used: ChatGPT 3.5

## Areas of Assistance:

1. **Verification of the project structure setup**
   - Confirmation of proper directory organization
   - Validation of file naming conventions

2. **Code syntax verification**
   - Python syntax checking
   - Playwright API usage verification
   - Import statement validation

3. **Verification of the cart icon bug found on different browser window sizes**
   - Discussion of the rendering issue discovery
   - Validation of the testing approach for different viewport sizes
   - Confirmation of screenshot capture methodology

## Important Notes:

- All test strategy, business logic, and architectural decisions were made independently
- The LLM was used only for verification and syntax guidance
- The critical finding of the cart badge rendering issue was discovered through manual testing and observation
- Final code implementation and quality assurance were performed manually

## Key Independent Work:

- Page Object Model design and implementation
- Test case design and requirement coverage
- Bug discovery and documentation process
- Screenshot evidence collection and organization
- Professional documentation creation
